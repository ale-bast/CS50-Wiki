## Project: Wikipedia-like Online Encyclopedia

This project involves designing a simple online encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia. Users can access encyclopedia entries on various topics. Each entry can be viewed by visiting the respective entry's page, just like you would visit a Wikipedia page by going to URLs like `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML`. These encyclopedia entries are stored using a lightweight, human-friendly markup language called Markdown. When a user views an entry, the Markdown content is converted into HTML for display.
